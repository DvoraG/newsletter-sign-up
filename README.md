## My process

Usually I would start to setup the desktop structure first in HTML, but this time I found it easier to begin 'mobile first' in the HTML too.

In the next step I added the styling and only when this was ready, I started to implement the functionality with JavaScript.

For the validity check of the email I used the solution found on https://www.w3schools.blog/email-validation-javascript-js. I chose this approach here, for demonstrating the success and error messaging only.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

First time I tried the BEM naming convention, which I found very helpful to create a better understandable code. Still, there is much left to learn.

### Continued development

For sure my JS coding needs a lot of polishing.
